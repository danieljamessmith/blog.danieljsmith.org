After a period of inactivity, this blog is back online with a new home at [blog.danieljsmith.org](https://blog.danieljsmith.org).

It now sits alongside the [tuition.danieljsmith.org](https://tuition.danieljsmith.org) and [resources.danieljsmith.org](https://resources.danieljsmith.org) sites.

Built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

[Claude Opus 4.5](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-5) in [Cursor](https://cursor.com/) provided major assistance with the restyling and redeployment of the blog on the new subdomain.
